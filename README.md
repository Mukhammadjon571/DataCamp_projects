# DataCamp_projects

I'm collecting my solutions to [DataCamp Projects](https://www.datacamp.com/projects) here so that I can quickly review them at my own leisure. I might have expanded upon or played with the notebooks after submitting them, so the outputs might no longer meet the requirements.

|  Project | Keywords  |
|---|---|
| Introduction to DataCamp Projects | jupyter-notebook  |
| Exploring 67 years of LEGO  | read_csv, data aggregation  |
| A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones  | networkx, centrality measures, sorting DataFrames |
